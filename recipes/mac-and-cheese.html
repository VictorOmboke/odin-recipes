    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>For a pan of classic, special occasion-worthy mac, our easy baked macaroni and cheese recipe is the best around.
        You’ll want to whisk warm milk into the flour mixture to ensure a lump-free sauce. We also recommend shredding
        your own cheese,
        rather than buying pre-shredded cheddar, for a creamier texture. (We tested this baked mac and cheese with
        Cracker Barrel Extra-Sharp Cheddar.)
        Follow these simple tips, and you’ll have yourself the perfect pan of golden, creamy macaroni and cheese, ready
        for any occasion, in no time flat.</p>
