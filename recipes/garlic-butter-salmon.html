    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Garlic butter smothered salmon is a given. It’s possibly one of the most amazing, delicious ways to eat a juicy
        piece of salmon and gets cooked twice a week in this house. It’s been a while since we gave you salmon and it’s
        time.</p>
    <p>Normally you may opt for pan seared salmon for a guaranteed crisp exterior with a fork tender interior. Our baked
        salmon recipe delivers soft, juicy and tender salmon on the inside with charred crisp edges. A delicious
        restaurant-quality dinner!</p>
